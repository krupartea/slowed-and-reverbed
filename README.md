# Slowed and Reverbed
This is a Telegram bot which transforms your `.mp3`-files in mysteriously-sounding tracks.

Users can select how much slower the resulting track will be.

The audio processing is based on [Pedalboard](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard), and the Telegram Bots API is convenient and pythonic thanks to [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyTelegramBotAPI/).
